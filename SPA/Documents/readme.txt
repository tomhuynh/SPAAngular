An Angularjs demonstration for .Net developers

1. Introduction:
This is a demonstration project which regards to my presentation "AngularJS for .Net developers" at Omaha .Net Microsoft Technology group.
It is a complete Angular SPA (Single Page Application) using Visual Studio from font end to back end which includes some samples & features of AngularJS. Hopefully it will give .Net developers an overview & the getting start about how to use AngularJS in .Net environment

2. Set up:
a. Pull the code from repository
b. Restore the backup database (extract SPA.zip to have SPA.bak file) under \SPA\Documents to your database
c. Change the connection string to point to your restore database

3. Please welcome to add more features of AngularJS that you think it is cool and you want to share.
