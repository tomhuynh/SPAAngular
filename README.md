1. Introduction:
This is a demonstration project which regards to my presentation "AngularJS for .Net developers" at Omaha .Net Microsoft Technology group.
It is a complete Angular SPA (Single Page Application) using Visual Studio from font end to back end which includes some samples & features of AngularJS. Hopefully it will give .Net developers an overview & the getting start about how to use AngularJS in .Net environment

2. Set up:
a. Pull the code from repository
b. Restore the backup database (SPA.bak) under \SPA\Documents to your database
c. Change the connection string (in WebAP\Web.config) to point to your restored database
d. Run update Nuget packages to make sure the the solution is built successfully

3. Welcome to add more features of AngularJS that you think it is cool and you want to share.
